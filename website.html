                <h1>WHAT ARE FORGE WORLDS</h1>
                <p>Forge worlds are planets deemed fit by the Machine God to be cradles for His creations. They are
                    planets blessed with industry, devoted eternity to toiling away to churn out the endless
                    quantities of weapons, munitions, armor, vehicles, and other wargear. They are all utilized by the
                    endless armies of the Imperium of man. These planets are beyond ancient, dating back to the Dark Age
                    of Technology
                    and surviving the Age of Strife more than 20 millennia ago. These factories cover the entirety of
                    the planet's surface and can go kilometers deep through the crust to mine away at its resources. The
                    tens of billions of
                    souls who inhabit these planets have their bodies stripped down and rebuilt with cybernetics so that
                    they may survive the toxic
                    conditions of the heavily polluted planet. One of these planets, dear pilgrim, is the planet Lucius.

                    <h3>Our inexhaustable armies</h3>
                    <p>The Skitarii are the cybernetic military forces of the Adeptus Mechanicus. They are uncountable
                        faithful servants of the Machine God who are stationed to protect forge worlds. They were born
                        human, but they were rid of the burden of their flesh and emotion; for flesh gets tired while
                        the machine does not, for flesh feel fear while the machine does not. They are built to
                        withstand the harshest environments. They will stand vigil without needing to sleep or rest for
                        the Omnissiah
                        drives them to greater heights.</p>

                    <h3>Planetary Defense Force</h3>
                    <p>The planet is covered with as much anti-voidship and anti-air weaponry as much as there are
                        factories.
                        These weapons represent the wrath of the Machine God to those who would harm its servants. They
                        are built to fire
                        the largest of shells. These weapons can be dozens of meteres long that can fire munitions are
                        large as small vehicles or lasershots as strong as the heat of a small star. Once the planet
                        becomes a target
                        for the pitible forces of the enemy, the planet's rage will not cease until all foes are
                        vanquished or ammunition has been completely depleted.

                    <p>No foe is safe from annihilation, even in the void of the stars. The holy forces of the Imperial
                        Navy are outfitted with
                        ships that are kilometers long, firing shells as large as train cars from Ancient Terra. These
                        avatars of the Machine God's contempt for the heretic
                        are floating cities in space as they are homes to hundreds of thousands of crew. They are holy
                        relics that are thousands of years old, where generations of crew
                        are born and died in its catacombs. They are armed with armor plates meters thick so that no
                        weapon, save that from their own,
                        can harm them.

                    <h1>WHY WE STAND OUT</h1>
                    <p class="p">What separates Lucius from the rest of the forge worlds is that we have access to
                        something that
                        even Mars, the birthplace of the Mechanicus, doesn't: the unmatched energy of a sun. Millenia
                        ago, the people of Ancient Terra theorized how to capture the a sizable amount of energy of a
                        star by emcompassing it in a megatructure. The entirety of the planet Lucius is one such
                        megastructure.
                        The energy output provides the forge world with more than enough power to meet its manufacturing
                        needs.
                        Lucius-pattern weapons and warengines have garnered a reputation for excellence across the
                        Imperium. These weapons are made of Lucium, an alloy that can only be forged with the energy of
                        a captured star. Those who walk with weapons made from Lucius are walking with relics as a holy
                        warrior of the Machine God</p>
